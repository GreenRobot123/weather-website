# Project Name:

Weather Explorer with React

## Motivation

Eager to deepen my proficiency in React and explore the creative realms of CSS, I embarked on a project that integrated a weather API, crafting a dynamic and visually engaging weather website.

## Project Overview

This weather website allows users to input any city, fetching and displaying real-time temperature and weather conditions. An immersive feature dynamically adjusts the background to mirror the current weather of the chosen city.

## Features

1. **Inputting Cities**

   - Users interact with a textbox to input the city for which weather data is desired.

2. **Outputting Weather Data**

   - Displays temperature and weather conditions for the inputted city.

3. **Dynamic Backgrounds**

   - Backgrounds seamlessly adapt to the weather conditions, enhancing visual representation.

## Learnings

This project served as an enriching experience, seamlessly blending JavaScript logic and CSS styling. It provided insights into API implementation and event handling, fostering a deeper understanding of web development dynamics.

## Future Improvements

1. **Enriched Data Presentation**

   - Consider expanding data features, such as humidity, "Feels Like" temperature, etc.

2. **Integrate Animations**

   - Elevate user experience with engaging and visually appealing animations.

3. **Enhanced Interactivity**

   - Augment the user interface to be more interactive beyond just input interactions.

## How to Use

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js
- npm or Yarn

Run in Terminal or File any of:

**Commands:**

- `npm start`: Initiates the App in Development Mode.
- `npm run test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production, optimizing and bundling.
